For $n ∈ ℕ$, prove that if sequence $s(n) ∈ ℝ$ converges to $a ∈ ℝ$
and $t(n) ∈ ℝ$ converges to $b ∈ ℝ$, then the sequence $s(n) * t(b)$ converges to
$a * b$.

The definition of "converges to" has been give below, see `def ConvergesTo ...`.

Complete the proof steps.
Your Lean code must be based on the following solution given by natural language:

Part I:
For any ε > 0, we choose z so that
0 < z = sqrt(ε/2 + u^2) - u
where u = (|a| + |b|) / 2,
therefore we can show that
z^2 + 2*u*z < ε  ... (eq 1)

Part II:
Since s(n) and t(n) converge, for the z > 0 and big enough n we have that
|s(n) - a| < z  ... (eq 2.1)
|t(n) - b| < z  ... (eq 2.2)
both hold. We then have
z * z ≥ |s(n) - a| * |t(n) - b|
      = |s(n)*t(n) - a*t(n) - b*s(n) + a*b|
      = |s(n)*t(n) - a*b - b*(s(n) - a) - a*(t(n) - b)|
      ≥ |s(n)*t(n) - a*b| - |b|*|s(n) - a| - |a|*|t(n) - b|  ... (eq 2.3)

Part III:
We thus have:
|s(n)*t(n) - a*b| ≤ z^2 + |b|*|s(n) - a| + |a|*|t(n) - b|  ... (due to eq 2.3)
                  ≤ z^2 + |b|*z + |a|*z   ... (due to eq 2.1, 2.2)
                  < ε   ... (due to eq 1)
which means s(n)*t(n) converges to a*b by definition.

Requirement:
* do NOT use the proof as given in MIL ch 3.6, use the proof given above!
